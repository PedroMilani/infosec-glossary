## Information Security Glossary

 #### Glossary for Information Security and IT purposes
 With the intent of helping professors and students in the area of InfoSec, I decided to create this glossary since one of the biggest issues for a student in the area of InfoSec is the ignorance of any term, definition, jargon or even words used by professionals in the field.
 
 ## Contributions
 For the purpose of this project, it's extremely important that contributors add more words to the glossary as it's humanly impossible for a single person to remember every and each term out there. Thus, the quality of this glossary might depend on how many contributions it has. To contribute, you must create a PR to the master branch and soon after analyzed it will be published (commited).
 
 ## Repo
 We separe the glossary in two files, the raw file (full glossary) and the detailed glossary (list of words with definition). In the future we plan to divide by languages too.
